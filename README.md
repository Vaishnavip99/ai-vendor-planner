# ai-vendor-planner
# Smart Vendor Recommender & Event Planner ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project was built as part of **Round 1 of the AI Developer Internship at UtsavAi**. It simulates a basic AI system that:

- Accepts user input: event type, budget, location, guest count, and date
- Recommends the most suitable **vendors** (venue, caterer, decorator)
- Suggests a **planning timeline** for the event
- Uses **mock data only**, with no external AI APIs

> Note: This is a **concept demo**, not a production-ready system. The logic is designed to reflect how a real AI assistant might work in a simplified event planning context.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Used

- Python (core logic)
- JSON (mock input/output data)
- Basic AI-style scoring logic (custom)
- Optional: Flowchart created using draw.io or Canva
